- Xcode 12.0 and above

### Deployment targets

- iOS 13.0 and above
- macOS 10.15 and above
- tvOS 13.0 and above

## Installation

To integrate the library into your project using [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), you can add the library as a dependency in Xcode â€“ see the [docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app). The package repository URL is:

```bash
https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-swift.git
```

Alternatively, you can add the library as a dependency in your `Package.swift` file. For example:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourPackage",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "YourPackage",
            targets: ["YourPackage"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-swift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0")),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourPackage",
            dependencies: ["Pusher"]),
    ]
)
```

You will then need to include an `import Pusher` statement in any source files where you wish to use the library.
